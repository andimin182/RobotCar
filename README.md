# RobotCar

The aim is to construct a 4W robotic car with a Raspberry pi 4 B as a microcontroller.

## Server part
On the server part, i.e. on the raspberry pi, we installed Ubuntu Mate 20.04 with ROS Noetic.

## Client part
The client part will be represented by my personal laptop, that will connect to the server in order to communicate with it.
